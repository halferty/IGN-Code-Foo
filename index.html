					<!-- QUESTION 1 --> 
					<h2>Question 1</h2>
					<q>How many ping pong balls would it take to fill an average-sized school bus?</q>
					<p>Before I get to the wall of text, here's some general (pseudo)code that summarizes
					my approach to solving the problem:</p>
					<pre class="prettyprint">
// Constants
// All length dimensions in meters.
PING_PONG_DIAMETER = 0.04;
PACKING_DENSITY = 0.62;
BUS_INTERIOR_LENGTH = 9.13;
BUS_INTERIOR_WIDTH = 2.44;
BUS_INTERIOR_HEIGHT = 1.83;

SEAT_WIDTH = 1.0;
SEAT_BACK_HEIGHT = 0.61;
SEAT_BOTTOM_LENGTH = 0.51;
SEAT_THICKNESS = 0.075;
SEAT_ROWS = 12;

// Individual seat volume
seatVolume = (SEAT_WIDTH * SEAT_THICKNESS *
	(SEAT_BACK_HEIGHT+SEAT_BOTTOM_LENGTH));

// Volume of all seats
seatsVolume = (seatVolume * SEAT_ROWS * 2);

// Interior volume, ignoring seats
baseInteriorVolume = (BUS_INTERIOR_LENGTH *
	BUS_INTERIOR_WIDTH *
	BUS_INTERIOR_HEIGHT);

// Subtract seat volume
interiorVolume = (baseInteriorVolume -
	seatsVolume);

// Get ping pong ball volume
pingPongBallVolume = ((4/3)*(Math.PI) *
	Math.pow((PING_PONG_DIAMETER/2.0), 3));

// Assuming ping pong balls are cubes,
// how many could fit?
basePingPongBallsPerBus = (interiorVolume /
	pingPongBallVolume);

// If a certain percentage of that is empty
// space, calculate the actual value.
pingPongBallsPerBus = (basePingPongBallsPerBus *
	PACKING_DENSITY);
	
					</pre>
					<p>According to wikipedia, a regulation ping pong ball has a diameter of 40mm. This
					gives a volume of 33.5 cm<sup>3</sup>. This means 29,850 ping pong balls would fill
					a one meter cube, if they were also cubes. We need to find out how much of that space
					is actually occupied.
					According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_close_pack#For_spheres">
					another</a> wikipedia page, if we assume the "poured random packing" model, the
					spheres have a packing density of 0.609 to 0.625. Choosing 0.62 quite arbitrarily,
					we can assume that the actual number of spheres packed into a 1 meter cube is
					18,507 (29850*0.61). Now we need to determine the volume of the interior of the
					school bus.
					<a href="http://www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/buses/choosing_schoolbus/pre-school-bus_06.html">
					According to the NHTSA</a>, the average interior width of a school bus is
					90 inches (2.29 meters). According to <a href="http://ntl.bts.gov/lib/10000/10600/10694/MBTC1054-1.pdf">
					another government site</a>, the overall length of a Type C school bus is 10.86 meters. 
					Now, we need to subtract the length of the engine compartment (assuming we want to be
					able to bus these ping pong balls about. Otherwise filling the bus is just silly,.. right?).
					Anyway, my strategy is to find a side-view image of the bus and count the pixels. I'm
					totally serious. Using Figure 3 on
					<a href="http://www.pabulletin.com/secure/data/vol26/26-37/1532b.html">this page</a>,
					from the windshield forward is 89 pixels. From the windshield back is 559 pixels. So,
					the interior length is about 84.1% of the total length, which comes to 9.13 meters.
					If we ignore the fact that the roof of the bus may be curved, most tyle c school busses
					have a ceiling height of about 6' (1.83 meters). These three figures give a volume of
					38.26 cubic meters.
					<p>Of course, we still need to subtract the volume of the seats. I'll assume the seats
					are 75mm thick on both the bottom and back parts. According to
					<a href="http://www.isbe.state.il.us/funding/pdf/seat_belts_07-5758.pdf">yet another
					govt. doc</a>, the typical three-person seat width is 39 inches (1 meter). I'm going
					to guesstimate the seat length (based on my personal recollection) to be 20 inches
					(0.51 meters). The last thing we have to determine is the seat back height.
					As fortune would have it,
					<a href="http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/fmcsr/fmcsrruletext.aspx?reg=571.222">
					there is a law in effect</a> mandating that seats must have
					backs that are 24 inches high (up from the previous standard of 20 inches). They
					cite the effect higher seats have on managing unruly children. Now if only they would do
					some research into controlling unruly ping pong balls. 24 inches is 0.61 meters,
					giving us a total seat volume of 1.0 * 0.075 * (0.61 + 0.51) or 0.084 cubic meters.
					This gives us a total internal volume of 38.26 - (0.084 * 24) or 36.24 cubic meters.
					A little dimsneional analysis and we have (36.24 cubic meters) * (18507 ping pong balls / 1 cubic meter)
					which gives us 670,694 ping pong balls per bus. Or if you run the javascript code above, you get
					<b>716,967</b> ping pong balls. (Lesson learned: Never send a human to do a machine's job.)

					<!-- QUESTION 2 --> 
					<h2>Question 2: Fluid Layout</h2>
					<p>You're looking at it. :P</p><p>I would choose a fluid layout if I thought it wouldn't pose
					a problem for mobile users. If the page is primarily text or scalable CSS/HTML5 elements, a
					fluid layout may work better than creating a separate mobile view.</p>
					<p>(Of course, my CSS skills are virtually nonexistent. I just cobbled this page
					together from looking at open-source three-column layouts around the web).</p>
